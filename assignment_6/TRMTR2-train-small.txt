3598864-14	Due to the apparent importance of the enriched genes in the categories of (i) cellular component organization or biogenesis; (ii) FUNCt; (iii) response to stress/stimulus and (iv) cellular component organization or biogenesis, we evaluated the mRNA abundance of (i) PDR15 (YDR406W) encoding a transporter involved in multidrug resistance; (ii) PROT (YDR011W) encoding a plasma membrane ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, multidrug transporter involved in multidrug resistance and resistance to singlet oxygen species; (iii) TIM10 (YHR005C-A) encoding and essential protein of the mitochondrial intermembrane space, that forms a complex with Tim9p (TIM10 complex) and delivers hydrophobic proteins to the TIM22 complex for insertion into the inner membrane; (iv) VMA7 (YGR020C) and (v) VMA21 (YGR105W).

7475916	The effects of flavonols on P-glycoprotein (PROT) activity were studied in cultured rat hepatocytes by assessing and FUNC of Rhodamine-123 (R-123) and doxorubicin (DOX).	A9A492	Pgp	GO:0022857	transmembrane transport	GoodComention
3473298-23	Overexpression of the ABCB1/MDR1 gene coding for the FUNC P-glycoprotein (PROT) is a common course of multi drug resistance (MDR).	A9A492	P-gp	GO:0022857	transmembrane transporter	GoodComention
9168435	Drug resistance in AML is multifactorial but can be associated with the overexpression of FUNC molecules, including PROT (Pgp) or the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP), or associated with inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, as well as overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2.
